🚀 Reverse a String in Shell Scripting – No Built-in Commands! 🚀


Sometimes in support interviews, you're asked to solve basic problems without using built-in commands like rev, tac, or awk. Here's a great example I encountered recently:
🔁 Reverse a string using only bash scripting logic. Here's how I did it 👇

#!/bin/bash
str="shivani"
rev=""

for (( i=${#str}-1; i>=0; i-- )); do
  rev="$rev${str:$i:1}"
done

echo "Original: $str"
echo "Reversed: $rev"


✅ No external utilities used
🧠 Just pure logic with parameter expansion and loops!
💡 This kind of task can pop up in interviews, especially for L2/L3 support roles involving Unix and shell scripting.
