let‚Äôs break it down clearly and walk through an **actual working explanation** of the `awk` snippet:

---

### üîç The Command in Question:
```bash
awk '/START/{flag=1} flag; /END/{flag=0}' file.txt
```

---

### üß† What it‚Äôs Supposed to Do:
This script is intended to:
- Start printing lines **from "START"** onwards,
- Keep printing until it hits a line with **"END"**,
- **Include** both the "START" and "END" lines.

---

### ‚úÖ How It Actually Works:

```bash
/START/       { flag = 1 }  # Turn on the print flag when START is seen
flag                   # If flag is set (non-zero), print the line (default awk behavior)
/END/         { flag = 0 }  # Turn off the flag after END
```

### üß™ Example Input (file.txt):
```
Line A
START
Line B
Line C
END
Line D
```

### üü¢ Output:
```
START
Line B
Line C
END
```

So yes ‚Äî **it absolutely works** as described.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Confusion:
This doesn't **stop** printing immediately after `END`, it prints the line containing `END` too. If you **want to exclude** the `END` line, you need to change the order slightly:

```bash
awk '/END/{flag=0} flag; /START/{flag=1}' file.txt
```

That version:
- **Starts printing after START**
- **Stops printing before END**

---

### ‚úÖ Alternate Version (Exclude START/END themselves):
If you want to **exclude** both START and END lines from the output:

```bash
awk '/START/{flag=1; next} /END/{flag=0; next} flag' file.txt
```
