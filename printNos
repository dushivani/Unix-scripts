### âœ… **Print Numbers from 1 to 5**
```bash
read -p "Enter start number: " x
read -p "Enter end number: " y

for ((i=x; i<=y; i++))
do
  echo $i
done
```

---

### ğŸ§  Key Points:
- `read -p` only takes one variable at a time â€” if you want both in one line, you can do:
  ```bash
  read -p "Enter start and end: " x y
  ```
