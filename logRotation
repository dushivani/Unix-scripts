### 🔁 Automating Log Rotation with Shell Script

In production support, **automating log maintenance** is essential to ensure optimal performance and disk space management. Here's a simple shell script I used to **archive, compress, and clean up old log files**.

🛠️ **What it does:**
- Archives and compresses logs older than today
- Moves them to a backup directory
- Deletes archived logs older than 7 days

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set log and archive paths
log_dir="/var/log/myapp"
backup_dir="/var/log/myapp/archive"
days_to_keep=7

# Create backup directory if not exists
mkdir -p "$backup_dir"

# Find and compress yesterday's logs
find "$log_dir" -name "*.log" -mtime +0 -exec gzip {} \; -exec mv {}.gz "$backup_dir" \;

# Delete archives older than N days
find "$backup_dir" -name "*.gz" -mtime +$days_to_keep -exec rm -f {} \;

echo "✅ Log rotation complete."
```

🔍 **Why it's useful:**
- Prevents disk space overflow
- Keeps recent logs easily accessible
- Helps in better log retention strategy

📌 **Tip:** You can schedule this script using a cron job for daily execution!

### 🕒 How to Schedule a Shell Script Using Cron

**Step 1: Save Your Script**

Save the log rotation script to a file, for example:

```bash
/home/username/scripts/log_rotation.sh
```

Make sure it is **executable**:

```bash
chmod +x /home/username/scripts/log_rotation.sh
```

---

**Step 2: Open the Crontab**

Open your crontab file for editing:

```bash
crontab -e
```

---

**Step 3: Add a Cron Job Entry**

To run the script **daily at 2 AM**, add this line:

```bash
0 2 * * * /home/username/scripts/log_rotation.sh >> /home/username/scripts/log_rotation.log 2>&1
```

🔹 This means:
- `0` → Minute
- `2` → Hour (2 AM)
- `*` → Every day of the month
- `*` → Every month
- `*` → Every day of the week

`>>` appends output to a log file so you can track what the script does.

---

**Step 4: Save and Exit**

After saving the crontab, it will automatically install your cron job.

---

✅ Done! Your script will now run daily at 2 AM.
