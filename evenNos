ğŸ”„ Challenge: Print Even Numbers Between 1 and N
ğŸ§  Goal:

Ask the user to enter a number N

Print all even numbers from 1 to N (inclusive)

Example:
If user enters 10, output should be:

Copy
Edit
2
4
6
8
10

********************************************************************
read -p "Enter number: " x

for ((i=1; i<=x; i++))
do
  if (( i % 2 == 0 )); then
    echo "$i"
  fi
done
ğŸ§  Key Fix:
Use (( ... )) instead of [[ ... ]] for math comparisons.

(( i % 2 == 0 )) does arithmetic evaluation.

Also, good catch starting from 2 â€” but it's more flexible to loop from 1 and let the condition filter evens.
