🧠 **UNIX Interview Gotcha – No `sort`, `uniq`, or `awk`?!**

Had an interesting interview today where I was asked a common problem — but with a twist!

**❓ Q: Remove duplicate lines from a file… without using any UNIX built-in utilities like `sort`, `uniq`, or `awk`.**

Honestly, it felt a bit out of the blue at first (how often do we *not* use those tools in real life?). But it turned out to be a great exercise in logic and using plain shell scripting!

Here’s a pure shell solution using associative arrays in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

declare -A seen

while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ -z "${seen["$line"]}" ]]; then
        echo "$line"
        seen["$line"]=1
    fi
done < input.txt
```

📌 This script reads each line, checks if it's been "seen" before using a Bash hash map, and prints only the unique ones — no external commands involved!

✅ Good reminder that sometimes interviews test your fundamentals more than your day-to-day toolbelt.
